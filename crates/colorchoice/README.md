## [Contribute](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

Special note: to be successful, this crate **cannot** break compatibility or
else different crates in the hierarchy will be reading different globals.
While end users can work around this, it isn't ideal.    If we need a new API, we can make
the old API an adapter to the new logic.

Similarly, we should strive to reduce **risk** of breaking compatibility by
exposing as little as possible.  Anything more should be broken out into a
separate crate that this crate can call into.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be dual-licensed as above, without any additional terms or
conditions.
